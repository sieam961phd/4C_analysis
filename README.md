4C-Seq_Analysis

4C was performed on MCF7, with two biological replicates to assess the role of cohesin in regulation genetic interactions at the 6q25.1 locus. 10 viewpoints were designed spanning the region of interest. Knockdown of the Rad21 subunit of the cohesin complex was achieved through siRNA. A non-targeting siRNA was used as a control and results were normalised to a non-ligation control (? check this). The library was sequenced as paired-end reads with Illumina HiSeq by New Zealand Genomics Limited (NZGL). Demultiplexing was also performed by NZGL. To increase sequencing depth, two sequencing runs were performed on the same library.
